Work Experience
---------------

### Software Engineering

#### DECTRIS Ltd.
*Täfernweg 1, 5405 Baden, 2018 to present - 3 years 10 months*

**ERP infrastructure:**
I designed and setup the infrastructure to improve maintenance, development, testing and debugging of our ERP solution.
I established the tools to duplicate the production environment within minutes and therefore allow to debug unexpected behavior with current data.
Using the same tools I allowed to create development environments to execute projects in parallel with some level of isolation.
I also set up the monitoring infrastructure to allow generating and visualizing system information to identify unexpected behavior of our ERP solution and other legacy systems and increase transparency of our business data.

**ERP upgrade:**
I contributed to the analysis, planning and execution of the upgrade of our ERP solution.
The complexity of this project was given by the considerable amount of untested customizations of our ERP solution as well as the entanglement to further legacy systems.

**Principles of collaboration with partners and vendors:**
To improve the collaboration with our partners and external software vendors I introduced a set of values and principles.
Using these principles and our team's needs, I drafted the contract with our ERP vendor to support our collaborative intent.

**Software delivery cycle optimization:**
I took the responsibility for a production critical legacy system and reduced its build and deployment times by 90% to improve its development and maintenance.

**Manufacturing execution system evaluation:**
In a sandboxed experiment, I helped mapping DECTRIS' manufacturing processes in two solutions to evaluate the technology and collaboration with the solution's providers.

**Process and quality management team formation:**
I contributed to the formation of the team responsible to allow DECTRIS to adapt the business processes and its software landscape to current and future needs in a reasonable time span.
I established a set of values and principles for the collaboration within the team and helped defining the scope, vision and strategy.
I also introduced retrospectives and daily standup meetings to improve the collaboration within the team.

**Manufacturing execution system prototype:**
To understand the needs of our manufacturing, I prototyped a user interface for a manufacturing execution system.
It allows operators to pick tasks according to the specified work place and execute it.
It communicates with a backend via gRPC.

**Detector system user interface:**
I rewrote the user interface for one of our most important products.
It communicates with a backend via gRPC and allows users to get system status information and getting as well as setting the system's configuration.
The software structure is used as the new standard for further inhouse developed web user interfaces.

**Detector system calibration:**
I helped rewriting the system calibration - one of the most challengings steps of our production - using domain driven design.
I interpreted the old code, translated it to psuedo code to describe the procedure to the team and implemented parts of the new system calibration.
I also run the system calibration during the development to test the results.

**Hangouts Bitbucket service:**
I built a service to send messages to specified Google Hangouts channels.
It receives updates from the Bitbucket server on several repository events and passes relevant information to the configured hangouts channel.

**Detector assembly test:**
I collaborate in the development of a framework to test our detector's assembly.
It allows to automatically detect missing connections or defects in the assembled detector.

**Git trainings:**
I prepare trainings, in which the functionality and internals of Git are discussed, to improve the quality of our collaboration.

**Used technologies:**
Python, py.test, Cypress, Vue.js, Vuex, Vue Router, gRPC, Flask, marshmallow, Git, Bitbucket, pip, Bazel, Ansible, requests, Docker, Helm, Drone, Buildkite

Used methodologies:
BDD, TDD, pair programming, mob programming, pike & stabilize, walk a mmile, DDD, event storming

#### 4teamwork AG
*Dammweg 9, 3013 Bern, 2017 to 2018* - 1 year 7 months

**Boilerplate for Django projects:**
I build and maintain the boilerplate for Django projects.
It allows configurable development, build, test and production environments.

See: https://github.com/4teamwork/bobtemplates.4teamwork

**Meeting assistance webapplication:**
In a team of three developers, we are building an application to digitize meetings.
It allows users to preview the meetings’ documents and add comments or notes.

**Business administration software - opengever.core:**
I collaborate in the development of the company’s business administration software.
To contribute to the product, the GitHub Flow workflow is required and test driven development was adopted.

See: https://github.com/4teamwork/opengever.core

**Event calendar for stadt.winterthur.ch:**
I developed and integrated an event calendar into Winterthur’s website.
It allows anonymous users to propose events and simplifies editor’s tasks.

[Sport Veranstaltungskalender](https://stadt.winterthur.ch/themen/leben-in-winterthur/freizeit-und-sport/sport/sport-veranstaltungen/app_view)

**Inspection administration and reporting software:**
In a team of two, we build an application to assist inspectors in their operative and reporting tasks. External data imports simplify inspection management tasks and inspection evaluation reduce reporting overhead.

**Substitution platform - einzelvertretungen-zh.ch:**
In a team of two, we built an application to permit priests to specify available dates, their preferred services and simplifies the search of possible substitutes in the case of a drop out.

**Used technologies:**

#### Adfinis SyGroup AG
*Giessereiweg 5, 3007 Bern - 2015 to 2016* - 8 months

**Server monitoring, alarming and reporting system - SyMonitoring:**
I helped implementing the evaluation for the outage reports and wrote the visualisation of the monitored infrastructure’s current status.

**OpenOffice patch:**
I wrote a patch for OpenOffice to prevent a confusing warning message, when a file is accessed, but its content was not altered.

**Used technologies:**
PHP, Javascript, jQuery, vis.js, Python, MySQL, Django, Vagrant, Git, GitLab, C++

Skills and competences
----------------------

### Soft skills
I am an active and empathetic listener.
Understanding my counterparts' needs is critical to me.
I attended a lecture on communication for engineers at the HSR.
I enjoy being a team player and supporting others solving tasks.

### Programming
Python is my weapon of choice.
I know its ecosystem and feel comfortable using its tools (venv, pip, unittest / py.test, jupyter, pdb, logging, …).
I also use C, C++, Javascript or Ruby where required.
In general, I enjoy learning new programming languages, frameworks and libraries, since they often come with useful, new concepts.
I’m very interested in service oriented architecture since the fist time I used ZeroMQ.

### Application development
I know how to develop, build and deploy and applications using continuous integration and deployment techniques.
Making applications configurable to deploy then in many different environments using the same codebase is easy to me.
I also learnt managing and isolating application dependencies to prevent dependency version conflicts.

### Problem solving abilities and analytical skills
I like tackling and solving complex problems using different techniques to find the most elegant or most pragmatic solution.
I can read and review other’s program code.
I also evaluate third party applications and libraries to foresee complications before using them.

### Documentation
I document my work according to the requirements.
I can create user manuals using Sphinx and used Swagger to create automatised API documentations.
Most of my personal projects come along with a markdown readme.
I use Git for documenting changes and code comments for complex snippets of code.

### Systems
I feel comfortable using the shell (on Linux and macOS).
I have some experience configuring http servers and databases.
I also worked with puppet, docker and vagrant and I am aware of technologies like packer, terraform.
I am very interested in the DevOps culture.

Extracurricular activities
