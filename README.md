Education
---------

### MSc in Physics
*Experimental Physics - University of Bern - 2015 to 2016*

#### Thesis: *SiPM Gain calibration for the scintillating Cosmic Ray Tracker*
I wrote a set of applications and used them to collect, evaluate and display data from the cosmic ray tracker panels.
These tools allow automatising the SiPM gain calibration process.
I also helped producing the panels in the workshop.

**Detector assembly test:**
I collaborate in the development of a framework to test our detector's assembly.
It allows to automatically detect missing connections or defects in the assembled detector.

**Git trainings:**
I prepare trainings, in which the functionality and internals of Git are discussed, to improve the quality of our collaboration.

**Used technologies:**
Python, py.test, Flask, marshmallow, Git, Bitbucket, pip, Bazel, Ansible, requests, Docker, Helm, Drone, Buildkite

See: https://github.com/4teamwork/bobtemplates.4teamwork

**Meeting assistance webapplication:**
In a team of three developers, we are building an application to digitize meetings.
It allows users to preview the meetings’ documents and add comments or notes.

**Business administration software - opengever.core:**
I collaborate in the development of the company’s business administration software.
To contribute to the product, the GitHub Flow workflow is required and test driven development was adopted.

See: https://github.com/4teamwork/opengever.core

**Event calendar for stadt.winterthur.ch:**
I developed and integrated an event calendar into Winterthur’s website.

**Server monitoring, alarming and reporting system - SyMonitoring:**
I helped implementing the evaluation for the outage reports and wrote the visualisation of the monitored infrastructure’s current status.

**OpenOffice patch:**
I wrote a patch for OpenOffice to prevent a confusing warning message, when a file is accessed, but its content was not altered.

**Used technologies:**
PHP, Javascript, jQuery, vis.js, Python, MySQL, Django, Vagrant, Git, GitLab, C++

Skills and competences
----------------------

### Soft skills
I am an active and empathetic listener.
Understanding my counterparts' needs is critical to me.
I attended a lecture on communication for engineers at the HSR.
I enjoy being a team player and supporting others solving tasks.

### Programming
Python is my weapon of choice.
I know its ecosystem and feel comfortable using its tools (venv, pip, unittest / py.test, jupyter, pdb, logging, …).
I also use C, C++, Javascript or Ruby where required.
In general, I enjoy learning new programming languages, frameworks and libraries, since they often come with useful, new concepts.
I’m very interested in service oriented architecture since the fist time I used ZeroMQ.

### Application development
I know how to develop, build and deploy and applications using continuous integration and deployment techniques.
Making applications configurable to deploy then in many different environments using the same codebase is easy to me.
I also learnt managing and isolating application dependencies to prevent dependency version conflicts.

### Problem solving abilities and analytical skills
I like tackling and solving complex problems using different techniques to find the most elegant or most pragmatic solution.
I can read and review other’s program code.
I also evaluate third party applications and libraries to foresee complications before using them.

### Documentation
I document my work according to the requirements.
I can create user manuals using Sphinx and used Swagger to create automatised API documentations.
Most of my personal projects come along with a markdown readme.
I use Git for documenting changes and code comments for complex snippets of code.

### Systems
I feel comfortable using the shell (on Linux and macOS).
I have some experience configuring http servers and databases.
I also worked with puppet, docker and vagrant and I am aware of technologies like packer, terraform.
I am very interested in the DevOps culture.

Extracurricular activities
--------------------------

I spend most of my free time climbing.
