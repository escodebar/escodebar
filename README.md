# Greetings! 👋 I'm Pablo Vergés, but you may know me as escodebar

Welcome to my digital playground!
By day, I'm a Test Engineer at [House of Test](https://www.houseoftest.ch), the rebels of IT, where I've declared an all-out war on inefficiency.
While I may not be casting spells in dark corridors, my real magic happens at (un)conferences, where I host mind-blowing workshops to learn Git (and other topics). 🧙‍♂️💻

## 🚀 About Me

At House of Test, my role transcends traditional testing; I'm the architect behind the scenes, crafting the infrastructure and methodologies that enable effective and efficient testing.
Continuous integration, strategic test planning across various levels, and ensuring we're attacking the right problems at the right time – these are the realms I reign over.
My true strength lies in contextual awareness, adapting and applying the most effective methods for each unique scenario.
And yes, Git, paired with behavioral code analysis, often plays a key role in my arsenal.

When not engineering solutions, I'm adhering to bouldering walls, embracing the challenge, focus, and sheer joy it brings to my life. 🧗‍♂️


## 🛠️ My Toolbox

My toolkit is ever-evolving, selected meticulously to tackle specific challenges within our projects.
I'm a staunch advocate for:
- Linux, i3wm, tmux, vim, and ranger for a seamless development environment
- Python and pytest for crafting precise and efficient tests (but I'll also use any other test framework!)
- Git for source control, paired ingeniously with behavioral code analysis
- Concourse and nix for CI/CD and reproducible builds
- My custom Gergoplex keyboard, a testament to my dedication to both functionality and form
- Occasionally, a soldering iron for when hardware needs persuading

Curious about the full array of tools in my workshop? Check out my [CV](cv-pablo-verges.pdf) for a deep dive.

## 💡 Projects & Collaborations

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and collaborations, especially if it involves teaching, learning, or enhancing software quality.
Want to collaborate? Reach out to me or my manager (Ilari) at House of Test, depending on the nature of your project.

I'm also trying to keep up with weekly posts on LinkedIn about everything from software, efficiency, to the occasional insight into the tools and frameworks that make our work not just productive, but also enjoyable.

## 🤔 Pondering Software and Life

In the symphony of code, each line is a note, and humor is the rhythm that keeps us moving.
The question isn't whether humor belongs in software, but how we can weave it into our daily tasks, making our work not only effective but also engaging.

In a universe of binaries, be the source that compiles with both efficiency and joy. 🚀

Let's connect, collaborate, and maybe share a laugh or two. After all, why should our code have all the fun?
